Original SoundCloud description
-
This is my fourth solo album. "I'll Turn It On', was a commissioned piece for an exhibit at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, about the struggle of the Zuccaro brothers, a pair of struggling artists in the Renaissance era. Another song, "Heartbeat On The Radio", was inspired by an episode of the "All Time Top Ten" podcast in which the topic was "songs about radio". Check out the "Barbarella" inspired music video on YouTube!
