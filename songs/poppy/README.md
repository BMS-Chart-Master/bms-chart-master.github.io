COMMENT

■Daily Tenri (Music)I
am Daily Tenri. This time, in collaboration with Roon_kun, we will bring you [Poppy], a twin project of [Mandragora].
It's been two years, so time flies so fast ~~w (゚Д゚)w

This work is based on Shakespeare's "Othello".

「𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐲,𝐧𝐨𝐫 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐚,𝐍𝐨𝐫 𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐬𝐲 𝐬𝐲𝐫𝐮𝐩𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝,𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday."

From tender love and great trust to fierce jealousy and crazy hatred.

This could be [Poppy], psychedelic and crazy.

After this, I think there will be fewer opportunities to work with Roon_kun due to academic problems, so please cherish Columba's last work.

Finally, I hope you enjoy this entry!!

(DeepL translation) ■ Roon_kun (Music)


In line with the principle of writing in a meticulous structure, I am back at the BOF. The more I write, the more exciting I get, and the more I write, the more content comes to mind.

I'm having fun. I hope you all have a wonderful time.

We look forward to seeing you there. We also wish you good health.



TRAF (BGA)
TRAF. I made BGA.

It was difficult to come up with the visuals to match the mood of the song, but I think we did it well. Thank you in advance.
